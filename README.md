# MLP-CNN
This project aims to build a neural network model to solve the EMNIST classification problem.
Implemented two types of neural networks; one is the MultiLayer Prceptron (MLP) networks with hidden layers (i.e., neural networks with only fully-connected layers).
The other is the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with at least two convolutional layers.  
For each network model, multiple parameters were considered to obtain the best performance.
